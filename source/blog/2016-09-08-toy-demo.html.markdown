Our goal for the fall is to create a "capability demonstrator".  As we're just getting started we'll build from existing software and applications and mold them to higher level abstractions.


### Deploy a global file system on the fly: 

    $ vc3-pilot --require cvmfs

    [Demonstration](https://asciinema.org/a/40j5dnd6m67yog3y4qa4tw957)

### Deploy the MAKER application on the fly:

   $ vc3-pilot --require maker-ecoli-example-01
    
   [Demonstration](https://asciinema.org/a/4qzmcrpmrzssxen6s1knkgw86)

### VC3 jobs running on a campus cluster via "glide in"

### VC jobs running at ND via "hobble in"
